# Keeper-App

Keeper

Keeper is a web application built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React that allows users to create and manage notes. It is a mockup of Google Keep and was built as a personal project for portfolio purposes.

Installation:

To install Keeper on your local machine, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed. Once you have those installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory with your terminal by running: cd <project folder>
3. Install the required dependencies by running in terminal: npm install
4. Then run 'npm start' to start the app in your browser. The app will be running on http://localhost:3000

Usage:

When you open the app, you will see an input field in the middle of the page. Clicking on the input field will allow you to type in a title and content for your note. Once you have entered your note, click the "+" button to attach it to the page. You can repeat these steps to add additional notes.

If you want to delete a note, simply click on the bin icon and the note will be removed from the page.

Keeper - is a great example of my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. It was a challenging project that allowed me to practice my front-end development skills and showcase my ability to build a functional and user-friendly web app. I hope you find it useful and enjoyable to use!
